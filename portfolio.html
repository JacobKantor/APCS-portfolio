    <h1> Our project is a storytelling choose your own adventure game called Gorilla Warfare. It is about raiding a monkey temple to steal the banana stash. It has a title screen, and 3 screenstates. The title screen controls a turtle to spell out our title, using a while-loop to create the L’s in Gorilla. The next scene involves encountering a wild Boss Monkey, which updates to the second screenstate after the user inputs “banana.” This second screen involves using a banana gun to attack the opposing monkey, which activates an iteration loop when the user inputs “pew.” This causes a banana-like projectile (turtle) that both changes size and color after to advance forward, stamping and clearing its previous stamp to make it appear as if it is moving in slow motion.  After the monkey boss is defeated, the user is prompted to proceed to the treasure room by inputting “proceed.” This opens the final screenstate, congratulating the user for completing Gorilla Warfare and stealing the bananas.

    <h1> This project was a parody of the original flappy bird game, which we titled Flappy Turtle. After beginning the game by inputting ‘start’ (as prompted by the title screen), you are presented with a playable turtle on the left and moving pipes that approach the user from the right. The player controlled turtle can move up and down across a set y-value and stays at a constant x-value position, while the Pipe turtle is generated at a random y-value between (-150, 150) so that the player must move to avoid it. Upon passing the turtle on the left side of the screen, the i value that increases by one every time the pipe moves left 3 would have become greater than 370, which prompts the Pipe turtle to reset to the right side of the screen (x-value of 600) with a new color and random y-value.<h1>
