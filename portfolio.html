    <h1> Our project is a storytelling choose your own adventure game called Gorilla Warfare. It is about raiding a monkey temple to steal the banana stash. It has a title screen, and 3 screenstates. The title screen controls a turtle to spell out our title, using a while-loop to create the L’s in Gorilla. The next scene involves encountering a wild Boss Monkey, which updates to the second screenstate after the user inputs “banana.” This second screen involves using a banana gun to attack the opposing monkey, which activates an iteration loop when the user inputs “pew.” This causes a banana-like projectile (turtle) that both changes size and color after to advance forward, stamping and clearing its previous stamp to make it appear as if it is moving in slow motion.  After the monkey boss is defeated, the user is prompted to proceed to the treasure room by inputting “proceed.” This opens the final screenstate, congratulating the user for completing Gorilla Warfare and stealing the bananas.

    <h1> This project was a parody of the original flappy bird game, which we titled Flappy Turtle. After beginning the game by inputting ‘start’ (as prompted by the title screen), you are presented with a playable turtle on the left and moving pipes that approach the user from the right. The player controlled turtle can move up and down across a set y-value and stays at a constant x-value position, while the Pipe turtle is generated at a random y-value between (-150, 150) so that the player must move to avoid it. Upon passing the turtle on the left side of the screen, the i value that increases by one every time the pipe moves left 3 would have become greater than 370, which prompts the Pipe turtle to reset to the right side of the screen (x-value of 600) with a new color and random y-value.<h1>

    <h1> For this scratch project, my group parodied the google dinosaur game you can play when your computer loses internet access. By pressing the start flag, the player is set to a position where they can input spacebar to jump. A obstacle with the cactus sprite then glides towards the player, which has a costume that is randomly selected value from a list that determines the amount of cacti that approach the player. A successful jump (defined by making contact with the ground without the dinosaur touching the cactus) will increase the score by 100 points, and the displayed timer increases every second to inform the user how long they have survived. When the dinosaur makes contact with the cacti, Game Over is broadcasted which inturn prompts the code for moving the cactus to stop and display the Game Over Screen. Clicking the restart button on the Game Over sprite broadcasts Game Start, which prompts the dinosaur to regain control, cacti to begin moving again, reset the score, and reset the timer.

    <h1> Our group decided that enviornment is most likely to be a desert, as our sketched graphs for each concept closely resemble the graphs we created from the data. The graph for light resembles a constant and bright enviornment, which is represitive of the Desert as it is open to the heat of the sun. There is correlation between our sketch and data for sound as well, as the sudden sharp increase and decreases resemble the chirping of animals. Our temperature sketch also closely fits the description of a desert, as it reaches very low at night, while also hitting a constant high during the day. It makes sense for there to be constant wind as well, as the open landscape in a desert is the perfect enviornment for festering regular strong winds.
